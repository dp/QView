Welcome to QView.

QView is an MQ network explorer, mapping tool and admin console.
It has some very powerful features, such as the ability to invoke a runmqc like interface on a qmgr node remotely at the click of a button.

QView is functional.

Some of these functions, such as reading and writing messages, are very rudimentary.

I have used the utility in my work as an MQ administrator, but it is still a bit rough around the edges. It is too large for one man alone to manage. There is great potential for this software, but I NEED YOUR HELP to round out features and to log and address issues.

The utility is based on the Netbeans 6 platform, and to be honest, the implementation of platform components is still a bit hacky. Please help refactor changes if you know how things SHOULD be done.
